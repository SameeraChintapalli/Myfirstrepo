HACKATHON : it is a challenge to complete a task within time period
**DevOps=Development+Operations
Developers- Who Writes Code
Operations-Who Develop/manage systems
--> Work together, instead of working in silos
⦁	code is automatically tested and deployed
⦁	it reduces time and bugs 


REAL TIME EXAMPLE:
imagine you're building a mobile app like swiggy.
⦁	the developer writes code to add "track my order"" feature.
⦁	without devops: Developer gives code to ops team-->they manually deploy-->bugs happen-->delay
⦁	with devops: code is automatically tested and deployed--> customers get updates faster and safely.
DevOps Helps You:
⦁	release features faster(Like adding new payment methods in zomato)
⦁	fix bugs quickly
⦁	automate repetitive tasks 


EIGHT PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT
1.	PLAN:define what to build
2.	DEVELOP: Writes the code
3.	BUILD: compile code into deployable format
4.	TEST: check for bugs automatically
5.	RELEASE: approve the build for deployment
6.	DEPLOY: push app to servers or app store
7.	OPERATE: keep app running,fix any issues
8.	MONITOR: analyze performance and feedback
